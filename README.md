# Simple Counter App

This project is a basic web application that demonstrates a functional counter with increment, decrement, and reset capabilities. It showcases the fundamental interaction between HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior.

## Features

*   **Counter Display**: Shows the current numerical value of the counter.
*   **Increment Button**: Increases the counter value by one.
*   **Decrement Button**: Decreases the counter value by one.
*   **Reset Button**: Resets the counter value to zero.
*   **Dynamic Styling**: The counter's text color changes based on its value:
    *   Green when the counter is positive.
    *   Red when the counter is negative.
    *   Purple-blue when the counter is zero.
*   **Responsive Layout**: The main content is centered on the page.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using standard web technologies:

*   **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Provides the basic structure and content of the web page. It defines the heading, paragraphs, the counter display area, and the interactive buttons.
*   **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Styles the appearance of the HTML elements. It dictates the layout, colors, fonts, button designs, and ensures a visually appealing and centered user interface. It also includes hover effects for buttons and dynamic color changes for the counter display.
*   **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the web page. It handles:
    *   Retrieving HTML elements (like the counter display and buttons).
    *   Managing the counter's numerical value.
    *   Responding to button clicks (increment, decrement, reset).
    *   Updating the counter's text content and its color dynamically based on its value.
