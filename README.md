# Simple Project

This is a basic web application demonstrating a dynamic counter with interactive controls and real-time visual feedback.

## Features

*   **Counter Display**: Shows a numeric value that can be manipulated.
*   **Increment Functionality**: A button to increase the counter's value by one.
*   **Decrement Functionality**: A button to decrease the counter's value by one.
*   **Reset Functionality**: A button to set the counter's value back to zero.
*   **Dynamic Styling**: The counter's text color changes based on its value:
    *   Green when the counter is positive.
    *   Red when the counter is negative.
    *   Blue/Purple when the counter is zero.
*   **Responsive Layout**: The main content area is centered on the page.
*   **Styled Interface**: Modern button styles with hover effects.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using fundamental web technologies:

*   **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Provides the structure and content of the web page. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, buttons, and the counter display area, linking them together to form the user interface.
*   **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Controls the visual presentation and layout of the HTML elements. It defines styles for colors, fonts, spacing, button appearance, background gradients, and how elements are positioned on the page, including hover effects for interactivity.
*   **JavaScript**: Adds dynamic behavior and interactivity to the web page. It handles user actions (like button clicks), manages the counter's numerical state, updates the display in real-time, and applies conditional styling to the counter text based on its value.

## How to Run

To run this project, simply follow these steps:

1.  **Save the files**: Ensure you have `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` in the same directory.
2.  **Open `index.html`**: Double-click on `index.html` in your file explorer, or open it in your preferred web browser.

The web application will load, displaying the counter interface.
